# Repository Overview

This repository primarily focuses on statistical learning, following the book _Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python_. I want to say a big thank you to my friend [@thecodingmooseofficial](https://github.com/thecodingmooseofficial) for recommending this book to me. I am already learning so much, and I really do appreciate your help as we go through this together.

Let's follow the guide designed for us, looking forward to delving into ML and stats.
